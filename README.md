# Roasted Chessnuts üî•‚ôüÔ∏è

A chess application where every move you make gets roasted by AI
commentary! Play against the computer while receiving witty,
sarcastic, and sometimes brutal commentary on your chess skills. The
AI commentator doesn't hold back ‚Äì prepare to have your chess ego
thoroughly roasted.

Built with Next.js, FastAPI, and powered by vLLM for generating savage
commentary and [Daisys TTS](https://daisys.ai) for delivering the
burns in natural-sounding voice. Developed in collaboration with
Claude Code.

A running version can be found at
[https://chessnuts.internal.daisys.ai](https://chessnuts.internal.daisys.ai).

This application can serve as an example of how to stream efficiently
with fast response times from the [Daisys
API](https://daisys-ai.github.io/daisys-api-python).

## Getting Started

This project uses Docker Compose for local development. To get
started:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will start all services including the frontend, backend API, and
nginx proxy. The application will be available at
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

The development environment includes hot-reloading, so you can edit
files and see changes immediately without restarting containers.

## Key Technologies

### Text-to-Speech (TTS)
The application integrates with the Daisys TTS API for real-time audio
commentary. Features include:
- WebSocket-based streaming for low-latency audio playback
- Multiple voice support with random voice selection
- Real-time chess move commentary generated by vLLM

### Chess Engine
This project uses [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js) for
chess game logic and move validation, along with
[react-chessboard](https://github.com/Clariity/react-chessboard) for
the interactive chess board UI.

## Local Development with Docker Compose

This project includes a Docker Compose setup for local development:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will start:
- Frontend (Next.js) on port 3000
- Backend API on port 8000
- Nginx proxy on port 8080

Access the application at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

First you'll need to create `.env` based on `.env.example` with your
keys and passwords.

## AWS Deployment

This project includes a complete AWS deployment setup using Docker,
CloudFormation, and CloudFront.

### Quick Deploy

1. Create a `.env.deploy` file in the project root with your AWS
   configuration, see `.env.example`
2. Run the deployment script:
```bash
./deploy/deploy.sh
```

For detailed deployment instructions, see [deploy/DEPLOYMENT.md](deploy/DEPLOYMENT.md).
